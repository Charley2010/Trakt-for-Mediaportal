This project implements the Trakt api for Mediaportal and Moving Pictures.

Some code has been directly taken from the mptvseries implementation of Trakt
http://code.google.com/p/mptvseries/

In order to have desired effects please also install Moving Pictures
http://code.google.com/p/moving-pictures/

If you are a plugin developer for Mediaportal and would like to have your plugin supported for scrobbling of either Movies or TV Series feel free to contact me.
